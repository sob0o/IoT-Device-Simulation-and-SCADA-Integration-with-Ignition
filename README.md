# IoT Device Simulation with MQTT, Docker, and Ignition Integration

This project simulates IoT devices using Docker containers, publishes data via MQTT, and integrates with Ignition for real-time data visualization. It provides a framework for simulating sensor data (e.g., temperature and humidity) from multiple IoT devices, sending this data over MQTT, and processing it in Ignition.

## Features
- Simulates multiple IoT devices with sensor data (temperature, humidity).
- Publishes data over MQTT using Mosquitto broker.
- Integrates with Ignition for real-time data visualization.
- Runs entirely in Docker containers for ease of setup.

## Requirements
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Ignition (for visualization)
